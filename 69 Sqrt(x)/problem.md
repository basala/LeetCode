## Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of x.

x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

## Example1:
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

## Example2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we want to return an integer, the decimal part will be truncated.
